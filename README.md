# Handwriting Recognition Classifier
#### This project used Neural Network and Deep Learning based Handwriting recognition. The goal of this project is to build a 10-class classifier to recognize those handwriting digits. 

#### Data Source: The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

#### Result: We built a CNN model with 96% accuracy and using 6% of 60K training dataset
